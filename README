 This is my personal firewall setup that I have
 been using for many years. It grows and things
 get added as I read about them and such...

 Most people I know, have theire own setup and
 private scripts. This is ment for me and people
 who wants to use it. It can also be used for
 education and iptables/ip6tables examples to
 include in your own scripts etc.

 After dote is started, you should check with
 iptables-save | less
 ip6tables-save | less
 to see if dote is doing what you expected it to
 do :)

 No warrenty is provided ;)
